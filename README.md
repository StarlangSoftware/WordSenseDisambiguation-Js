# Word Sense Disambiguation

## Task Definition

The task of choosing the correct sense for a word is called word sense disambiguation (WSD). WSD algorithms take an input word *w* in its context with a fixed set of potential word senses S<sub>w</sub> of that input word and produce an output chosen from S<sub>w</sub>. In the isolated WSD task, one usually uses the set of senses from a dictionary or theasurus like WordNet. 

In the literature, there are actually two variants of the generic WSD task. In the lexical sample task, a small selected set of target words is chosen, along with a set of senses for each target word. For each target word *w*, a number of corpus sentences (context sentences) are manually labeled with the correct sense of *w*. In all-words task, systems are given entire sentences and a lexicon with the set of senses for each word in each sentence. Annotators are then asked to disambiguate every word in the text.

In all-words WSD, a classifier is trained to label the words in the text with their set of potential word senses. After giving the sense labels to the words in our training data, the next step is to select a group of features to discriminate different senses for each input word.

The following Table shows an example for the word 'yüz', which can refer to the number '100', to the verb 'swim' or to the noun 'face'.

|Sense|Definition|
|---|---|
|yüz<sup>1</sup> (hundred)|The number coming after ninety nine|
|yüz<sup>2</sup> (swim)|move or float in water|
|yüz<sup>3</sup> (face)|face, visage, countenance|

## Data Annotation

### Preparation

1. Collect a set of sentences to annotate. 
2. Each sentence in the collection must be named as xxxx.yyyyy in increasing order. For example, the first sentence to be annotated will be 0001.train, the second 0002.train, etc.
3. Put the sentences in the same folder such as *Turkish-Phrase*.
4. Build the [Java](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/WordSenseDisambiguation) project and put the generated sentence-semantics.jar file into another folder such as *Program*.
5. Put *Turkish-Phrase* and *Program* folders into a parent folder.

### Annotation

1. Open sentence-semantics.jar file.
2. Wait until the data load message is displayed.
3. Click Open button in the Project menu.
4. Choose a file for annotation from the folder *Turkish-Phrase*.  
5. For each word in the sentence, click the word, and choose correct sense for that word.
6. Click one of the next buttons to go to other files.

## Classification DataSet Generation

After annotating sentences, you can use [DataGenerator](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/DataGenerator-CPP) package to generate classification dataset for the Word Sense Disambiguation task.

## Generation of ML Models

After generating the classification dataset as above, one can use the [Classification](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/Classification-CPP) package to generate machine learning models for the Word Sense Disambiguation task.

Detailed Description
============

## Sentence

In order to sense annotate a parse tree, one can use autoSemantic method of the TurkishSentenceAutoSemantic class.

	let sentence = ...
	let wordNet = new WordNet();
	let fsm = new FsmMorphologicalAnalyzer();
	let turkishAutoSemantic = new TurkishSentenceAutoSemantic(wordnet, fsm)
	turkishAutoSemantic.autoSemantic()
